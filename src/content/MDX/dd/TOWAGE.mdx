# Towage

<div data-type='wrapper'>
Mediterranean Shipping Register develops towage plans in accordance with the resolution MSC/Circ.884 “Guidelines for safe ocean towing” together with issuing of Towage survey certificate. We are designing passage and towage plans for any kind of vessel and non-propelled facilities. Pre-sailing survey on behalf of ship or cargo owners always performed before actual towage/passage operations in order to approve towing ship and object of towing. Such survey includes:

- A proper inspection of the towing vessel and its towing equipment
- Review of the certificates of the towing vessel, the stability of the towed object, and the seaworthiness of the towed object

On basis of the above MSR issues a Towage certificate which also contains instructions for the master of towing vessel regarding the route, weather/sea, shelters, speed, reporting, etc.
