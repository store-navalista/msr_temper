# Surveys

<div data-type='wrapper'>
An experienced and skilled staff of the Mediterranean Shipping Register performs all kinds of surveys. There are the following class survey types:

- 1\. Initial survey: before the submission of the ship into class.
- 2\. Periodical survey:
- 2.1 Annual survey for class confirmation is intended for establishing that the ship complies to a sufficient degree with the conditions of class, as well as for checking the operation of machinery, devices and installations covered by the requirements of the MSR Rules.
- 2.2 Intermediate survey shall be carried out either at or between the second and third annual surveys. Items, which are additional to the items to be surveyed at annual surveys, may be surveyed either at or between the second and third annual survey.
- 2.3 Special survey for class renewal is intended for determining whether the ship's technical condition and structural and composition modifications of its items comply with the requirements of the MSR Rules. Special survey shall be carried out at 5-year intervals to renew the class.
- 2.4 Survey of the outside of the ship's bottom (underwater hull, sea inlets, bottom and side valves).
- 3.0 Occasional survey – class surveys related to miscellaneous issues/problems/questions like changing of navigational area/ship’s purpose/number of crew onboard / ship’s design,  towage operations, accident aftermath, etc.

Besides the above-mentioned class surveys MSR experts carry out other non-class inspections including, but not limited to:
