# Amendments to the International Grain Code

<div data-type='wrapper'>
SOLAS Chapter VI, Part C requires cargo ships carrying grain on an international voyage to comply with the requirements of the International Grain Code. These requirements include the ship needing to have a grain loading manual approved by the Administration or a Recognised Organisation.

The IMO has now published amendments to the International Grain Code, which enter into force on 1 January 2026. Introduced by IMO resolution MSC.552(108), the amendments include a new loading condition for special compartments. 

#### **Grain Code loading conditions** 

The grain code currently includes the following loading conditions: 

- Filled compartments, trimmed 
- Filled compartments, untrimmed 
- Partly filled compartments 

The code amendments now define a new, optional loading condition: 

- Specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed (see figure below):

#### **What shipowners and operators should do now**

Shipowners and operators should ensure that any ship planning to load grain as per this newly defined optional condition – “specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed” on or after 1 January 2026 has that condition included in its approved grain loading manual.

#### **Approval of grain loading manual**

Operators may submit their amended grain loading manual to Lloyd’s Register for review (or submit an addendum to the grain loading manual for review) ahead of 1 January 2026.
