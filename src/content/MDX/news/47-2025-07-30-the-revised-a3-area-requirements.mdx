# The revised A3 Area Requirements

<div data-type='wrapper'>
The revised SOLAS Chapter IV (IMO Resolution MSC.496(105)), effective 1 January 2024, brings updated requirements for radio communications applicable to all new and existing ships operating in Sea Area A3.
 
The IMO’s COMSAR Sub-Committee has also updated its guidance on radio installations through COMSAR.1/Circ.32/Rev.3, superseding Rev.2, focusing on harmonization of GMDSS requirements and improving safety and distress communication.
 
Revised Equipment Requirements

Ships trading in Areas A1 – A3 must ensure compliance with updated radio equipment requirements:
 - VHF radio with DSC and continuous watch on channels 70 and 16.
 - MF radio with DSC watch on 2187.5 kHz and HF DSC as applicable.
 - Satellite Earth Station (SES) for Recognized Mobile Satellite Service (RMSS).
 - EPIRB, Radar SART or AIS SART, and portable GMDSS VHF radios.
 - Automatic position updates to all relevant communication systems. 
<br/>

#### **DuplicationofEquipment**

A single MF/HF radio installation may now serve as both:
 - The primary MF installation.
 - The duplicated MF/HF installation (as clarified in Rev.3).
<br/>

#### **PassengerShipRequirements**

Passenger vessels must also carry:
 - 'Distress panel' and 'distress alarm panel' (SOLAS IV/6.4 & 6.6).
 - Two-way on-scene communication on 121.5 MHz and 123.1 MHz from the navigating bridge. 
<br/>

#### **To be implemented:**
 - All ships must ensure their GMDSS equipment meets the post-2024 configuration as per COMSAR.1/Circ.32/Rev.3.
 - Surveyors and auditors should verify compliance during routine and special surveys.
 - Ship managers and operators should review equipment duplication and confirm regulatory approval.
