# Classification Services

<div data-type='wrapper'>
Classification is a thorough and professional evaluation of the compliance of a vessel’s design, construction, and condition with the established rules and standards of the Mediterranean Shipping Register (MSR), as well as relevant national and international technical regulations. This evaluation covers not only the vessel’s hull structure and machinery systems but also vital components such as navigation and communication equipment, safety systems, fire protection arrangements, and pollution prevention installations.

The primary purpose of classification is to determine the initial eligibility for assigning a class to the vessel, as well as to perform periodic assessments that allow for the renewal, reassignment, confirmation, or withdrawal of the class depending on the vessel’s continued conformity with MSR's rigorous standards. These procedures ensure that the vessel remains fit for its intended service and capable of operating safely and reliably over time.

MSR's role as a classification society is a cornerstone of maritime safety. Our services contribute directly to the preservation of human life at sea, the protection of the marine environment, and the safe transport of passengers and cargo. We ensure that vessels under our class operate in accordance with well-established safety principles that have been developed and refined over decades of maritime experience.

Moreover, classification is a critical element in the maritime industry's safety chain, as it provides independent technical assurance to shipowners, flag states, port authorities, and insurers. By carrying out surveys during design review, newbuilding, and throughout the operational life of the vessel, MSR supports its clients in maintaining compliance, reducing operational risks, and enhancing the reliability and value of their fleets.

As part of our commitment to excellence, MSR also provides advisory services on technical matters, offers guidance on compliance with evolving international conventions (such as SOLAS, MARPOL, and ICLL), and assists in adapting ships to new safety or environmental requirements. In doing so, we remain a trusted partner in helping maritime stakeholders meet both current and future challenges of safe and sustainable shipping.
