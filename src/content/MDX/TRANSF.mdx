# Transfer of Class

<div data-type='wrapper'>
We want you to have the best partner to support the safe, compliant, and efficient operation of your vessels, both now and in the future. As your classification society, MSR will work closely with you in the ongoing management of your fleet, helping you realise each vessel’s full operational and commercial potential. We offer practical support, technical guidance, and professional assistance in resolving any technical challenges, deficiencies, or exceptional conditions that may arise during the vessel's life cycle. Above all, our priority is to support you in maintaining your vessels’ continuous trading status with minimal disruption.

If you are considering changing to us as your class partner, you can be assured that we will make the transfer of class (TOC) process as straightforward, transparent, and efficient as possible. Our dedicated technical and administrative teams will guide you through each step of the process, providing clear instructions and timely responses, ensuring minimal impact on your operations. We recognize the importance of continuity, predictability, and operational clarity in the transfer process, and we strive to deliver a service that reflects these values.

Transfer of class (TOC) is the process by which your vessel is formally reassigned from one classification society to another—in this case, to MSR class. This involves a review of existing records, survey history, and applicable certificates, followed by a physical inspection or verification as required. We ensure that all steps are carried out in accordance with International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) procedures and best practices.

Transferring your vessels to MSR class is not only a fast and simple process—it is also an opportunity to begin working with a partner that places emphasis on personalised support, prompt decision-making, and a pragmatic approach to vessel safety and compliance. With MSR, you gain access to an organisation that values long-term relationships, operational trust, and the success of your fleet.

Whether your motivation for transfer is related to service quality, strategic realignment, technical philosophy, or global support, MSR is ready to demonstrate its value from the very first interaction. We are committed to earning your confidence and becoming your trusted classification partner.
